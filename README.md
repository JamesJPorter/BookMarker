## Description

This application is a convenient book searching and bookmarking tool. Using it you can search and save books to your profile, keeping track of books you may wish to read, have read or which you may generally wish to not forget. The app allows a user to signup in order to save their list of books and utilizes a MERN stack structure with Apollo server and graphQL architecture. The current version of the application is the result of a refactor from a restful API structure.
